#ToDOApp
Create a "To-Do List" application with a graphical user interface. The application should allow users to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks. You can also add features like task categories, due dates, and reminders.

Here are some features you can consider implementing in your application:

    - A main window that displays the list of tasks and their status (completed or not).
    - A form to add a new task with text input and a button to add it to the list.
    A checkbox or button to mark tasks as completed.
    A button to delete tasks.
    A menu bar with options to save and load the list of tasks from a file.
    A search bar to filter tasks by keyword or category.
    A calendar view to display tasks by due date.
